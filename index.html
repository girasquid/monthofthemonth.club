      <h1>The month of the month club: an off-the-wall idea that&apos;ll go right on your walls.</h1>
      <h2>Or maybe your fridge. But definitely not in your trash can.</h2>

      <p>It&apos;s that time again.</p>

      <p>That time when this month becomes last month and next month becomes this month, because that&apos;s how time works.</p>

      <p>But what if we told you that <em>it doesn&apos;t have to work that way?</em></p>

      <p>Well, it does. The tyranny of time is a well-documented phenomenon.</p>

      <p>But it <em>doesn&apos;t need to be.</em></p>

      <p>What if we told you instead that there&apos;s a <em>visually appealing, helpfully measurable and occasionally asynchronous</em> way of monitoring the ceaseless march of time and its ever-diminishing effect upon our lives?</p>

      <p>Like a monthly subscription.</p>

      <p>Not just any monthly subscription. An actual, literal, physical monthly subscription &mdash; a <em>month of the month</em>.</p>

      <p>A month of the month delivered in <em>paper form</em> to your door or perhaps your letterbox or the white-gloved hand of your butler Jeeves.</p>

      <p><em>A month of your very own.</em></p>

      <p>The kind of month you can spend <em>any way you want</em> in any place that accepts paper months as legal currency.</p>

      <p>A whole month that's yours and yours alone to do <em>whatever you want</em> with.</p>

      <p>The kind of month you can roll up in your pocket, fold into a paper plane or even use as a kind of avant garde placemat like Salvador Dal&iacute; might have if he&apos;d come up with this idea instead of painting melting clocks, which is actually thematically quite close but no cigar. Or lobster.</p>

      <h3>So what can you expect from your month of the month subscription?</h3>

      <p>A month each month, that&apos;s what. A month each month discerningly selected by some guy maybe named Jeff.</p>

      <p><em>But not just any guy maybe named Jeff</em>. A guy maybe named Jeff who might also go by Jeffrey when he&apos;s in trouble with his girlfriend or Geoffrey when he&apos;s been reading too much Chaucer, or something else entirely because his name maybe isn&apos;t Jeff at all. Perhaps it&apos;s Fred. Or Juan.</p>

      <p>Whatever his name, it&apos;s thanks to the keenly artistic eye of this guy that each month of the month features a glossy spread of dubious artistic quality along with a stylish grid outlining the days of the month in <em>chronological order &mdash; plus</em> moon phase iconography, irrelevant local holidays and in some instances hand-jotted notes from a previous owner.</p>

      <p>Hand-prised from staple bindings or torn with reasonable care from the aforementioned staple bindings&apos; spiral counterparts by the younger and completely uncompensated brother of the guy maybe named Jeff, each month is representative of an <em>entire month</em>.</p>

      <p>But that&apos;s not all.</p>

      <p>If the incorrect month has been sent for reasons accidental, nefarious or cleverly mischievous but largely opaque, the month may even be representative of not just an entire month &mdash; but an <em>entirely different month</em>.</p>

      <h4><em>And there&apos;s more.</em></h4>

      <p>If your month of the month has been taken from a cheaply made double-sided calendar, you&apos;ll also get a chronologically problematic but nevertheless <em>free</em> clipping from the month that comes <em>before or even after</em> your month!</p>

      <p>That's up to an <em>additional 31 days</em> of extra value.</p>

      <p>To give you an idea of just how much extra value we&apos;re talking, it would take <strong>124 leap years</strong> to gain that many extra days through the normal passage of time.</p>

      <p>Money can&apos;t buy time. But it can buy months. And that&apos;s almost as good.</p>

      <p>The fact of the matter is that a month just isn&apos;t a month without a month of the month subscription. Well it is, but it&apos;s not.</p>

      <p>Truly, there&apos;s no sounder investment for the discerning individual except perhaps a bottle of aged Scotch, a portfolio of Apple shares and a good deal of other things that don&apos;t need to be named here because this entire sentence is undermining the purpose of this sales page.</p>

      <p>The month of the month club.</p>

      <p>It&apos;s better than a day of the month club. A bit worse than a year of the month club. But on average not a bad deal, especially since those other clubs don&apos;t exist and also because the success of the internship of the brother of a guy maybe named Jeff depends on it.</p>

      <p>So tear down your existing wall calendars and <em>carpe monthem</em>.</p>

      <p>Take out a 3-month, 6-month or 12-month month of the month subscription this month and receive a month of a month every month at the beginning of the month or whenever we get a chance to go to the post office.</p>

      <p>The possibilities are limited only by your imagination, the available space on your walls and the length of your subscription.</p>

      <p>So buy the long one.</p>
